        "# From Raw Data to Resolved Identities: Transforming Your Data for Senzing Entity Resolution\n",
        "## Step-by-Step Strategies to Prepare Your Data for Accurate, Scalable Identity Matching\n",

        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Entity resolution is all about untangling messy data to match records that refer to the same real-world entity, like spotting duplicates of a customer with slightly different names or addresses.  It’s the secret sauce for fixing data quality issues, linking information across datasets, and getting a clear, 360-degree view of your customers.  Senzing is a plug-and-play AI solution designed to make entity resolution fast, easy, and scalable.  It works in real-time to uncover connections in your data, giving you a clear view of every record linked to a person, company, or a multitude of other entity types through the use of a simple SDK-like interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "In my [previous blog post](https://senzing.com/knowledge-graphs-graph-rag/) I showed the importance of doing entity resolution to create entity-resolved knowledge graphs (ERKGs).  It was based on the [introduction to ERKGs](https://senzing.com/entity-resolved-knowledge-graphs/) by Paco Nathan.  While these two posts showed the importance of using entity resolution in creating knowledge graphs, they only briefly demonstrated how one maps real world data into Senzing for entity resolution.  In this post, I will show with real-world data how one would take a CSV file in Python and generate files that can be read and analyzed by Senzing.\n",
